## Some AI ideas

## Feedback on Proposal

> Checkers with simple AI is nice: alpha-beta would make for a nice goal to reach. But minimax/alpha-beta algorithms are only as
> good as the heuristic functions used to assign a "value" to a board. Do careful research here to see what others have found to work.
>
> Learning OpenGL is a fun idea, but I am concerned about the amount of effort it would take. I expect it would take far less
> effort to draw the board on the Arduino that can be controlled via the touch screen + stylus. You could communicate with a
> desktop program that runs the AI.
>
> I think this variant sounds nice for a 2-person project: one could focus on AI and the other on the Arduino + communication aspect.
>
> Ultimately it is up to you. Just remember that time can run out quickly if you spend time trying to get OpenGL working for
> your project (the TAs will likely not be able to help much if you go this direction). Also, whatever you do must run on the
> VM: you can provide instructions for installing other packages if necessary but make sure it runs on the VM.
>
> But the overall idea is nice. Go for it, just make sure you have a manageable task when it comes to displaying and
> manipulating the board.
