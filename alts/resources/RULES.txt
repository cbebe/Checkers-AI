Rules

  * Moves are allowed only on the dark squares, so pieces always move diagonally. Single pieces are always limited to forward
  moves (toward the opponent).
  * A piece making a non-capturing move (not involving a jump) may move only one square.
  * A piece making a capturing move (a jump) leaps over one of the opponent's pieces, landing in a straight diagonal line on the 
  other side. Only one piece may be captured in a single jump; however, multiple jumps are allowed during a single turn and can 
  be made in any direction.
  * When a piece is captured, it is removed from the board.
  * If a player is able to make a capture, there is no option; the jump must be made. If more than one capture is available, the 
  player is free to choose whichever he or she prefers.
  * When a piece reaches the furthest row from the player who controls that piece, it is crowned and becomes a king. One of the 
  pieces which had been captured is placed on top of the king so that it is twice as high as a single piece.
  * Kings are limited to moving diagonally but may move both forward and backward. (Remember that single pieces, i.e. non-kings, 
  are always limited to forward moves.)
  * Kings may combine jumps in several directions, forward and backward, on the same turn. Single pieces may shift direction 
  diagonally during a multiple capture turn, but must always jump forward (toward the opponent).
